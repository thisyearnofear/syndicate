# Production Button Click Fix

## Critical Issues Fixed:

### 1. WalletConnect Project ID
- **Problem**: Using placeholder `YOUR_PROJECT_ID_HERE` causing 403 errors
- **Fix**: Set proper environment variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID`

### 2. Touch Event Conflicts  
- **Problem**: Dual `onClick` and `onTouchEnd` handlers causing event conflicts
- **Fix**: Unified to single `onClick` with `preventDefault()`

### 3. Button Component Inconsistency
- **Problem**: Mixed imports between two different Button components
- **Fix**: Standardized to use `@/components/ui/button`

## Required Environment Variables:

```bash
# Get a free project ID from https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_actual_project_id_here
```

## Deployment Steps:

1. **Get WalletConnect Project ID:**
   - Go to https://cloud.walletconnect.com/
   - Create a new project
   - Copy the Project ID

2. **Set Environment Variable:**
   - In Vercel: Project Settings â†’ Environment Variables
   - Add: `NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id`

3. **Redeploy:**
   - Trigger a new deployment after setting the environment variable

## Additional CSS Fix:
The CSS syntax error suggests a build issue. Try:
```bash
npm run clean && npm run build
```

## Testing:
After deployment, buttons should:
- Respond to clicks immediately
- Not show 403 errors in console
- Work on both desktop and mobile
