/// The Threshold for deciding whether a lock time value is a height or a time (see [Bitcoin Core]).
///
/// `LockTime` values _below_ the threshold are interpreted as block heights, values _above_ (or
/// equal to) the threshold are interpreted as block times (UNIX timestamp, seconds since epoch).
///
/// Bitcoin is able to safely use this value because a block height greater than 500,000,000 would
/// never occur because it would represent a height in approximately 9500 years. Conversely, block
/// times under 500,000,000 will never happen because they would represent times before 1986 which
/// are, for obvious reasons, not useful within the Bitcoin network.
