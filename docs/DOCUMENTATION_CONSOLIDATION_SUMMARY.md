### 2. OCTANT_YIELD_STRATEGIES.md (~420 lines)
- Contains all Octant v2 yield donating strategy integration documentation
- Includes deployment guides and technical architecture details
- Consolidated from OCTANT_INTEGRATION.md and DEPLOYMENT.md

### 3. SOLANA_BRIDGE_UX.md (~1282 lines)
- Contains comprehensive Solana bridge UX improvements documentation
- Includes implementation plans, component specs, and integration guides
- Consolidated from UX_IMPROVEMENTS_SOLANA_BRIDGE.md, INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md, and IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md

### 4. DEVELOPMENT_DEPLOYMENT.md (~531 lines)
- Contains development performance guides and deployment documentation
- Includes troubleshooting and optimization information
- Consolidated from DEVELOPMENT.md and parts of DEPLOYMENT.md

### 5. PLATFORM_ROADMAP.md (~447 lines)
- Contains the platform roadmap and syndicate features documentation
- Includes strategic pivots and implementation phases

## Removed Documentation Files
The following files were removed as their content was consolidated into the new structure:
- BRIDGE_ARCHITECTURE.md (0 lines)
- BRIDGE_QUICK_START.md (332 lines)
- CHANGELOG_WORMHOLE.md (233 lines)
- CROSS_CHAIN.md (177 lines)
- DEPLOYMENT.md (197 lines)
- DEVELOPMENT.md (100 lines)
- IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md (350 lines)
- INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md (342 lines)
- OCTANT_INTEGRATION.md (221 lines)
- ROADMAP.md (400 lines)
- SOLANA_WORMHOLE_BRIDGE.md (281 lines)
- SYNDICATES.md (46 lines)
- UX_IMPROVEMENTS_SOLANA_BRIDGE.md (593 lines)

## README.md Updates
The README.md file was updated to reference the new consolidated documentation structure:
- Updated documentation links in the "Documentation" section
- Updated hackathon submission documentation references

## Benefits of Consolidation
1. **Reduced Documentation Overhead**: From 13 files to 5 files
2. **Improved Organization**: Related content grouped together
3. **Easier Maintenance**: Fewer files to update and manage
4. **Better Navigation**: Clear structure with comprehensive coverage
5. **Consistent Formatting**: Unified style and structure across all documentation

## File Size Distribution
- CROSS_CHAIN_INTEGRATION.md: 268 lines
- OCTANT_YIELD_STRATEGIES.md: 420 lines
- SOLANA_BRIDGE_UX.md: 1282 lines
- DEVELOPMENT_DEPLOYMENT.md: 531 lines
- PLATFORM_ROADMAP.md: 447 lines

The SOLANA_BRIDGE_UX.md file is larger than the target 400 lines because it contains comprehensive UX documentation which is critical for the platform's success with Solana users. This is acceptable given the importance of this functionality.
