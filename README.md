# Syndicate

**Social lottery coordination on Avalanche, powered by Megapot's onchain lottery system**

Syndicate creates a powerful social coordination layer for lottery participation on Avalanche (Mewe & Arena decentralised social). By pooling resources with your social connections, you dramatically increase your collective chances of winning while embedding shared values into smart contracts.

## Vision

Transform social connections into financial impact. When your group pledges portions of potential winnings to causes like ocean cleanup or food aid, these commitments are automatically executed upon winning through smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **Megapot Integration**: Cause-based lottery pools on Avalanche
- **Social Coordination**: Pool resources with like-minded individuals
- **Automated Distribution**: Smart contracts handle payouts (e.g., 20% to cause, 80% to participants)
- **Transparent Impact**: All commitments executed automatically on-chain

## Why Syndicate?

Instead of chasing the entire pie alone, get a generous slice of a much bigger win together. The bigger your cause-branded Syndicate grows, the higher your chances of winning and creating impact while securing your personal share.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Choose your template:

   - `gator-nextjs-starter/` - MetaMask integration template

### ðŸš€ Getting Live

**Required Environment Variables**

```bash
# Copy .env.example to .env.local and configure:

# Pimlico (for gasless transactions)
NEXT_PUBLIC_PIMLICO_API_KEY=your_pimlico_key

# NEAR (for cross-chain)
NEAR_ACCOUNT_ID=your-account.near
NEAR_PRIVATE_KEY=ed25519:your_private_key

# WalletConnect (optional)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
```

**Deployment Steps**

1. Configure environment variables above
2. Deploy to Vercel/Netlify with environment secrets
3. Test wallet connections (MetaMask, NEAR)
4. Verify cross-chain flow (Avalanche â†’ Base)
5. Test Megapot ticket purchasing

**Key Functionality**

- **Standard Users**: Direct ticket purchasing on Base with MetaMask
- **Flask Users**: Gasless transactions with smart accounts
- **NEAR Users**: Cross-chain purchasing from Avalanche to Base
- **All Users**: Syndicate creation and cause-based coordination

### ðŸŽ¯ Live Demo Flow

1. **Connect Wallet** â†’ Multiple options with capability detection
2. **Choose Method** â†’ Standard, Gasless, or Cross-Chain
3. **Purchase Tickets** â†’ Seamless Megapot integration
4. **Track Activity** â†’ Real-time transaction monitoring
5. **Coordinate Impact** â†’ Automatic cause allocation

The platform is production-ready for individual ticket sales with full cross-chain support.
