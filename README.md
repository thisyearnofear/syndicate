# Syndicate

**Social lottery coordination on Avalanche, powered by Megapot's onchain lottery system**

Syndicate creates a powerful social coordination layer for lottery participation on Avalanche (Mewe & Arena decentralised social). By pooling resources with your social connections, you dramatically increase your collective chances of winning while embedding shared values into smart contracts.

## Vision

Transform social connections into financial impact. When your group pledges portions of potential winnings to causes like ocean cleanup or food aid, these commitments are automatically executed upon winning through smart contracts.

## Key Features

- **Megapot Integration**: Cause-based lottery pools on Avalanche
- **Social Coordination**: Pool resources with like-minded individuals
- **Automated Distribution**: Smart contracts handle payouts (e.g., 20% to cause, 80% to participants)
- **Transparent Impact**: All commitments executed automatically on-chain

## Why Syndicate?

Instead of chasing the entire pie alone, get a generous slice of a much bigger win together. The bigger your cause-branded Syndicate grows, the higher your chances of winning and creating impact while securing your personal share.
